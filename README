Usage: ./mailseek [options] [files]
Options:
  --no-recursive   Do not dive into directories, default is recursive
  --verbose        Provide verbose output on STDERR
  --debug          Provide debug output on STDERR
  --null           Separate file names by NUL chars, default is newline
  --details        Print some headers, not only the file name
  --case           Case sensitive match, default is case insensitive
  --any            Succeed if any criterion matches,
                   by default all criteria must match
  --filetime       Date-time filtering is based on file's mtime,
                   not on Email headers (faster)

Filter options:
  --newer, --older DATETIME  Consider Date, Delivery-Date, Received headers
  --sender PATTERN           From, Sender, Originator, Return-Path, Received
  --recipient PATTERN        To, Cc, Bcc, Delivered-To, Received
  --subject PATTERN          Subject, Thread-Topic
  --attachment PATTERN       Search in name of attachments (Email parts)
  --mime PATTERN/PATTERN     MIME type (type/subtype) of Email parts
  --header HEADER[:PATTERN]  Search for arbitrary header name 
                             and optionally for its content
  --body FTSEARCH            Body text (plain text and html are supported)

Formats:
  DATETIME    "YYYY-mm-dd_HH:MM:SS" - Meant in your timezone.
              Omitting less significant quantifiers makes them behave wildcard.
  PATTERN     a) simple string - match substring (see --case)
              b) "~REGEX" - match regexp if PATTERN starts with tilde
  HEADER      a) simple string - match exact string 
              b) "~REGEX" - match regexp just like PATTERN
  FTSEARCH    Fulltext search expression, see Search::Fulltext(3pm)

PATTERN and HEADER are optionally prefixed by '!' which inverts results.
HEADER and --mime matching are always case insensitive.
